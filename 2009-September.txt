Hello list,

Just installed the lateset asterisk ipcop from the install CD. I have a 
X100P card, but there is no zaptel driver? Am i doing something wrong?

regards,
Anthony.

Hi Anthony,

unfortunately there is no support for zaptel/dadhi
mainly because IPCop still has 2.4 kernel.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

That said, if you are not in a hurry, I'm curious to check compatibility between current digiun/clones hardware and 2.4 kernel.
Also checking conference (MeetMe) usability would be useful.
I can access most of the telephony cards but I can't say the same about spare time.


Regards and have a nice day,
Mike
